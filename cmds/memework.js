Before we can grant you membership and access to other channels, we must ask a few questions:
    - Who you are? (do you have any project that people know you for or something)
    - What do you do? (programming, chilling, memes, nothing?)
    - Where you came from? (who referred you to the server/gave the invite, etc)

Please post your answers here and a moderator or higher will check and then decide. This can take some time.

Note: The acceptance is done at our discretion and does not guarantee 100% acceptance. If you are denied, you will be kicked.
Please do not try to be persistent and keep joining back. Doing so will lead to a ban.`);
